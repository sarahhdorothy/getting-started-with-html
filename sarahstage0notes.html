<h2><center>How the Web Works</center></h2>
<p>
The Web is composed of three important elements that all have to work together in order for the web to work. First we have a person sitting on their computer using it to search things in a browser.When they try to go to any certain website,the internet has to send<b> http</b> requests to a<b> server</b>. The server then finds the websites code, called <b>html</b>, to send back to the computer. In the middle of all of that, the server might have to find links and references to images, videos, and other documents. 
</p>
<br>
<h2><center>HTML</center></h2>
<p><center>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and it is the language that programmers use <br> to write their code and websites.</center>
</p>
<br>
<h2><center>How Does Coding Work?</center></h2>
<p>
Coding is the tool that all programmers use to create the pages that everyone sees on the internet. In coding, there are different pieces that have to be used at specific times. There are tags and elements, inlines and blocks, images and links. It is difficult to keep them all straight and to use them in the correct way.

<h2><center>Programming is <em>AWESOME!</em></center></h2>
<p>
Programming is a skill that will be used for many years to come. But, it can also be a frustrating profession to choose. There are so many tags, elements, attributes, and changes that are put into HTML, that sometimes it is hard to remember all of them. If there is ever a time when one is stuck on a markup or CSS class, look it up! The internet is there to help!
  
</p>
<br>
<h2><center>Computers are Stupid</center></h2>
<p>
Computers are not necessarily stupid. But they do take everything literally. It is imperative that you double check your code and make sure that every comma and closing tag is in place. Otherwise, the computer <b>will not understand it!</b>
